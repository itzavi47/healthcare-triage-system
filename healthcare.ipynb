If your symptoms are severe, persistent, or you're concerned, please consult a doctor.\\n\\nHere are some safe home remedies for fever, cough, and tiredness:\\n\\n## For Fever:\\n\\n*   **Rest:** This is crucial for your body to fight off infection. Stay in bed and avoid strenuous activity.\\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration and help your body regulate its temperature. Good choices include:\\n    *   **Water:** The best choice.\\n    *   **Herbal teas:** Chamomile, ginger, peppermint, or elderflower teas can be soothing and have mild medicinal properties. Add a little honey if you like.\\n    *   **Broth:** Clear chicken or vegetable broth can provide hydration and some electrolytes.\\n    *   **Diluted fruit juices:** Opt for juices diluted with water to reduce sugar intake.\\n*   **Cool Compress:** Apply a cool, damp washcloth to your forehead, neck, or wrists. This can help you feel more comfortable. Avoid using ice-cold water as it can be too shocking.\\n*   **Light Clothing and Bedding:** Wear lightweight, breathable clothing and use light blankets. Avoid bundling up too much, as this can trap heat.\\n*   **Lukewarm Bath or Sponge Bath:** A lukewarm bath or sponge bath can help to lower body temperature. Ensure the water is not cold, as this can cause shivering and actually increase body temperature.\\n\\n## For Cough:\\n\\n*   **Honey:** Honey is a natural cough suppressant and can soothe a sore throat.\\n    *   **How to use:** Take a tablespoon of honey straight, or mix it into warm water or herbal tea. (Note: Do not give honey to children under 1 year old due to the risk of botulism.)\\n*   **Saltwater Gargle:** This can help to soothe a sore throat and loosen mucus.\\n    *   **How to use:** Mix 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water and gargle several times a day.\\n*   **Steam Inhalation:** Inhaling steam can help to loosen mucus and ease congestion.\\n    *   **How to use:**\\n        *   **Shower/Bath:** Take a hot shower or bath and breathe in the steam.\\n        *   **Bowl of Hot Water:** Carefully lean over a bowl of hot (not boiling) water with a towel draped over your head to trap the steam. Inhale deeply. You can add a few drops of eucalyptus or peppermint essential oil (if you have no sensitivities) for added benefit, but this is optional. Be very careful not to scald yourself.\\n*   **Humidifier:** Using a humidifier in your bedroom can keep the air moist, which helps to prevent your airways from drying out and can ease coughs.\\n*   **Herbal Teas:** As mentioned for fever, teas like ginger, thyme, and marshmallow root can be beneficial for coughs.\\n\\n## For Tiredness:\\n\\n*   **Prioritize Rest:** This is the most important remedy. Allow your body to recover. Sleep as much as you can.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Don't push yourself. If you feel tired, rest.\\n*   **Gentle Movement (if you feel up to it):** While rest is key, very light, gentle movement like a short, slow walk around the house might help if you're feeling up to it. Avoid anything strenuous.\\n*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Even when you're not feeling well, try to eat nutritious foods to give your body the energy it needs to heal. Focus on fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.\\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** Dehydration can worsen fatigue. Ensure you're drinking enough fluids as mentioned above.\\n\\n## Important Considerations:\\n\\n*   **Rest is Paramount:** For all these symptoms, the foundation of recovery is rest.\\n*   **Hydration is Key:** Drinking plenty of fluids is essential for managing fever and can also help with cough and fatigue.\\n*   **Avoid Irritants:** If you have a cough, try to avoid smoke, strong perfumes, and other irritants that can worsen it.\\n*   **When to Seek Medical Advice:**\\n    *   High fever (especially in children)\\n    *   Fever that lasts for more than a few days\\n    *   Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath\\n    *   Chest pain\\n    *   Coughing up thick, discolored mucus, or blood\\n    *   Severe sore throat making it hard to swallow\\n    *   Worsening symptoms\\n    *   Underlying health conditions that make you more vulnerable\\n\\nThese home remedies are intended to provide comfort and support your body's natural healing processes.

Don't push yourself.\\n*   **Hydration:** Staying hydrated is also important for muscle function and recovery.\\n\\n**For Headache:**\\n\\n*   **Rest in a Dark, Quiet Room:** Light and noise can often exacerbate headaches. Find a comfortable, dark, and quiet space to lie down.\\n*   **Hydration:** Dehydration is a common cause of headaches. Sip water throughout the day.\\n*   **Cool Compress on Forehead/Temples:** Similar to fever, a cool, damp cloth placed on your forehead or temples can provide relief.\\n*   **Peppermint Oil (Topical Application):** Dilute a few drops of peppermint essential oil with a carrier oil (like coconut or almond oil) and gently massage it onto your temples and forehead. Be sure to avoid getting it in your eyes. *Test a small area of skin first to ensure no reaction.*\\n*   **Ginger:** Consuming ginger can sometimes help with headaches, particularly those associated with inflammation. You can drink ginger tea or chew on a small piece of fresh ginger.\\n*   **Acupressure:** Gentle pressure applied to certain points on the body can sometimes relieve headache pain. A common point is the fleshy area between your thumb and index finger.

If your symptoms are severe, don't improve within a day or two, or are accompanied by other concerning signs like fever, dehydration, blood in vomit or stool, or extreme pain, please **seek medical attention from a doctor or healthcare professional.**\\n\\nHere are some safe home remedies for vomiting and stomach cramps:\\n\\n**For Both Vomiting and Stomach Cramps:**\\n\\n*   **Rest:** Give your body a break. Lie down in a comfortable position. For stomach cramps, sometimes a warm compress can be soothing.\\n*   **Hydration is Key:** Vomiting can lead to dehydration. Sip on clear fluids slowly and frequently.\\n    *   **Water:** The simplest and often the best.\\n    *   **Clear Broths:** Vegetable or chicken broth (low sodium if possible) can provide some electrolytes.\\n    *   **Electrolyte Solutions:** Over-the-counter options like Pedialyte or sports drinks diluted with water can be helpful, especially if vomiting has been significant. Sip them slowly.\\n    *   **Herbal Teas:**\\n        *   **Ginger Tea:** Ginger is well-known for its anti-nausea properties. Steep fresh ginger slices or ginger tea bags in hot water.\\n        *   **Peppermint Tea:** Peppermint can help relax stomach muscles and alleviate cramps, as well as ease nausea.\\n        *   **Chamomile Tea:** Known for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties, which can soothe an upset stomach.\\n\\n**Specific Remedies for Vomiting:**\\n\\n*   **BRAT Diet (for when you can keep something down):** Once you feel a little better and can tolerate food, the BRAT diet is often recommended. It's bland and easy to digest.\\n    *   **B**ananas\\n    *   **R**ice (plain white rice)\\n    *   **A**pplesauce\\n    *   **T**oast (plain, white toast)\\n*   **Avoid:** Greasy, fried, spicy, or highly seasoned foods. Also avoid dairy products and caffeine.\\n*   **Eat Small, Frequent Meals:** When you start reintroducing food, opt for very small portions to avoid overwhelming your stomach.\\n\\n**Specific Remedies for Stomach Cramps:**\\n\\n*   **Warm Compress:** Place a warm (not hot) water bottle or heating pad wrapped in a towel on your abdomen. The warmth can help relax the muscles and ease cramping.\\n*   **Gentle Movement (if possible):** Sometimes, very light walking or gentle stretching can help. Avoid strenuous activity.\\n*   **Deep Breathing Exercises:** Focusing on slow, deep breaths can help relax your body and mind, which can sometimes alleviate muscle tension contributing to cramps.\\n*   **Avoid Gas-Producing Foods:** Until your stomach settles, avoid beans, broccoli, onions, carbonated drinks, and artificial sweeteners.\\n\\n**Important Considerations:**\\n\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If a remedy makes you feel worse, stop using it.\\n*   **Hygiene:** Wash your hands frequently, especially after using the bathroom, to prevent spreading any potential infections.\\n*   **Avoid Lying Flat Immediately After Eating:** If you manage to eat something, try to sit upright for at least 30 minutes to an hour afterward.\\n\\n**When to Seek Medical Advice:**\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional if:\\n\\n*   Vomiting is continuous and you can't keep any fluids down for more than 24 hours.\\n*   You show signs of dehydration: dry mouth, decreased urination, dizziness, fatigue, sunken eyes.\\n*   You have severe abdominal pain.\\n*   There is blood in your vomit or stool.\\n*   You have a high fever.\\n*   Your symptoms are accompanied by difficulty breathing.\\n*   You have a known underlying medical condition.\\n\\nThese home remedies are for general relief and are not a substitute for professional medical advice.\", 'safe_otc': \"Error: 503 UNAVAILABLE. {'error': {'code': 503, 'message': 'The model is overloaded.
